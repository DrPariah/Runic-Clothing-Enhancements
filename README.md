# Runic-Clothing-Enhancements
Simple mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Three tiers of basic clothing enhancements (Lesser, Normal, Greater) that will modify your clothes with what it says on the tin. There's one for every pre-Nested type of clothing enhancement possible. Convert precious metals (copper, silver, gold) into Rune Stencils, and use them with a Tailor's Kit or Enchanted Tailor's Kit to modify your clothing. As these are enchantments, they have no weight or encumbrance penalty. However, they do somewhat self-limit, as the difficulty of adding multiple enhancements goes up dramatically.
The enhancements do stack, and they can get somewhat crazy, so use your discretion. On the other hand, you can use these to armor a suit and fedora and run around like an action hero that may or may not be played by Keanu Reeves, so...

UPDATE 2/13/24: Kept you waiting, huh?
- fixed issues with invalid flags
- added actual flags for the chitin inserts, and updated them roughly in line with the regular BN armor mod formula
- Regular BN armor mods base their numbers off 1/2 (approximately, and rounded down) of the material resistance of the material used to mod, and base their effect only on thickness. For the moment, the Runic mods will remain based on thickness _and_ coverage on the grounds that they're magic. Coverage means more surface for the runic stencils, thickness means more for the magic to work from.
