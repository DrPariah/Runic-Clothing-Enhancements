# Runic-Clothing-Enhancements
Simple mod for C:DDA. Three tiers of basic clothing enhancements (Lesser, Normal, Greater) that will modify your clothes with what it says on the tin. There's one for every pre-Nested type of clothing enhancement possible. Convert precious metals (copper, silver, gold) into Rune Stencils, and use them with a Tailor's Kit or Enchanted Tailor's Kit to modify your clothing. As these are enchantments, they have no weight or encumberance penalty. However, they do somewhat self-limit, as the difficulty of adding multiple enhancements goes up dramatically.
The enhancements do stack, and they can get somewhat crazy, so use your discretion. On the other hand, you can use these to armor a suit and fedora and run around like an action hero that may or may not be played by Keanu Reeves, so...
